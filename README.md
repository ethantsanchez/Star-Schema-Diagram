# Star-Schema-Diagram
Created SQL tables to align with the star schema pattern, with several dimension tables each containing 1:M relationships with one fact table. Performed data integrity checks and explored patient-provider pairs. Analyzed SQL schema, designed MongoDB schema, and developed an ETL script to create output for patients and their complete visit history.
